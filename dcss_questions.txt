  * Deliquency and Release

  1) Will participants always occur in a release file when they are released? Can a participant show up in November delinquency file, and then not show up in December's without being in a release?

    Assumption: Participants will always be in a release file when taken off delinquency. Therefore we don't need to compute the diff of delinquency files to find additional released participants.

  * SLM Returned Match Statistics File

  2) What is the format of this file in regards to the #3 SLM ACTION TYPE?

   Assumption: Each line in the file represent the statistics for that specific SLM ACTION TYPE. There will be 7 lines assuming we will use each ACTION TYPE.

  3) For fields #4 CUSTOMER_COUNT and #5 LICENSES PROCESSED does this include applicants who were not in the delinquency file? The interface will not have this information.

   Assumption: This will only include applicants who were in the delinquency file.

  4) What is the difference between fields #6 and #7? Assuming that they will both have the same returned action (DLQ, SUP, REN) they should be the same?

   Assumption: I will treat these the same.

  5) Fields #8, #9, #10 don't map to our process since we are using SSN, ID, and lastName. Is there a specific format for our matching?

   Assumption:  I will have field #8 represent SSN + lastName match, and field #9 represent ID + lastName match and leave field #10 blank.

  6) Assuming question #2 assumption is correct, what do fields #11 and #12 refer to? Wouldn't they be duplicate of fields #6 and #7 for the ACTION TYPES SUS and REL?

   Assumption: This is duplicate information of fields #6 and #7 for ACTION TYPES SUS and REL. For other ACTION TYPES they will be zero.
